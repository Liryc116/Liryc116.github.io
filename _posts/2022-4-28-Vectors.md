Let's start this series on data structures with vectors. Or list? Or arrays?

The terminology and definitions may vary so let's start by talking about this. 
The definition depends from where it comes form and what language we are talking about. 

For example C++ defines vector with in `<vector>` and it has the following properties:
- variable size
- non indexed
- "unefficient" access
- occupies more memory than necessary


The array is pretty much the complete opposite on these points.

The implementation we will see of vectors actually take from the two. 
It has the following properties:
- variable size
- indexed
- fast access
- occupies more memory than necessry

How does it work?
