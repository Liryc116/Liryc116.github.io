I would like to dedicate a series of post to data structures. 

We will discuss their properties, their assiocated methods, their use cases. We will see my personal generic implementation of the data structures in C and understand it.

Some details may come later as this series progress.

 Here's a non-exhaustive list of the structure I want to talk about:

 - Vectors
 - Linked Lists
 - Doubly Linked Lists
 - Queues
 - Stack
 - Heap
 - Binary Trees
 - Binary Search Trees (BST)
 - AVL (Balanced BST)
 - Bicolor Tree / Red Black tree
 - B Trees
 - General Trees
 - Graphs
