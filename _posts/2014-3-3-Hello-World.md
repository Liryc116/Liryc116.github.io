This is a pretty basic blog made with Jekyll. 
I'll mostly talk about what I do, why I do it and how I do it.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
